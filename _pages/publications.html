A dual GSH-depleting nanosystem (MnO₂@PDA@PEG@DOX) was designed and synthesized to achieve synergistic cancer treatment under ultrasound (US) stimulation. To enable an acidic response, dopamine (DA) was loaded onto manganese dioxide, significantly improving its water solubility and stability through PEG modification. Finally, the loading of doxorubicin (DOX) facilitated a combinational therapy approach. Upon reaching the tumor site, the acidic tumor microenvironment and high GSH expression triggered the degradation of the nanosystem, leading to the release of MnO₂ and DOX. The released MnO₂ reacts with intracellular GSH to produce Mn²⁺, which catalyzes H₂O₂ to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH), thereby enabling chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Additionally, the depletion of GSH further enhances •OH levels, improving CDT efficiency. The release of DOX is amplified by US stimulation, augmenting chemotherapy's effectiveness and achieving sonodynamic therapy (SDT). This dual GSH depletion strategy, combined with chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy, provides a promising approach for advancing combination cancer therapies.

  This study presents a tumor microenvironment-targeted nanoparticle system loaded with baicalein (PMs-Ba) to enhance treatment outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer. By inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway and activating the tumor immune microenvironment, PMs-Ba improved therapeutic efficacy, especially when combined with doxorubicin nanoparticles. The findings highlight baicalein-loaded nanoparticles as a promising strategy for enhancing nanotherapeutic performance in cancer treatment.

  <i>Erianin-Loaded Photo-Responsive Dendrimer Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: Exploration of a Psoriasis Treatment Method</i>. 
  <i>Molecules</i>, Volume 27, 2022.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.4;">
  Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by excessive keratinocyte proliferation. Erianin (Eri) is a promising drug for inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in psoriasis treatment. However, its poor water solubility and low penetration activity significantly limit its potential for local applications. To address these challenges, a novel photo-responsive dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle-based carrier was developed to enhance Eri's bioavailability and achieve sustained-release effects. The carrier's outer surface was functionalized with spiro pyran, APTES, and PPDTES, enabling UV radiation-triggered release of Eri. The physicochemical properties of Eri-DMSN@FSP were analyzed using advanced techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that Eri-DMSN@FSP could effectively undergo cellular endocytosis and respond to UV light to release Eri, providing a more effective strategy for psoriasis treatment.

  <i>Xanthatin Alleviates LPS-Induced Inflammatory Response in RAW264.7 Macrophages by Inhibiting NF-kB, MAPK and STATs Activation</i>. 
  <i>Molecules</i>, Volume 27, 2022.

<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height: 1.4;">
  The study explores the anti-inflammatory effects of xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone derived from the Chinese herb Xanthium. By stimulating macrophage cell lines with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the researchers observed that xanthatin reduced the production of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory factors. Additionally, xanthatin downregulated the mRNA expression of key inflammatory mediators, including iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, xanthatin inhibited the translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus, preventing the activation of inflammatory gene transcription. These findings suggest that xanthatin suppresses inflammation by modulating the NF-κB, MAPK, and STAT signaling pathways, positioning it as a promising candidate for anti-inflammatory drug development.
